### Alternative Launcher for Mount & Blade II: BannerLord

###### **Don't extract it into your game directory because you will most certainly break something.**

An extremely simple alternative to the standard launcher.
* Can read/write your LauncherData.xml, without breaking compatibility with the standard launcher.
* Supports only single player for now.
* Does some basic validation: official mods cannot be deselected, non single player mods cannot be selected, indicators when you place a mod before its dependencies.?

I am learning xaml (and the changes required for Avalonia) as I go, so my design choices might appear questionable.

As with all my projects, this will be maintained for as long as I am still interested in the game, feel free to fork or submit pull requests if you find me being too slow to react.

#### Maoci from here:

I hate WPF... why whould you even consider doing this that way... Anyway jokes asiade i edit some staff (not much) added button to go directly to Mods Directory also thinking to make ModList refresh button so you will not need to restart launcher each time you apply new mods ;) i simplyfied some things also (ps. yur github repo dont have images ...) i preffer grey/black colors
