### Alternative Launcher for Mount & Blade II: BannerLord

###### **Don't extract it into your game directory because you will most certainly break something.**

An extremely simple alternative to the standard launcher.
* Can read/write your LauncherData.xml, without breaking compatibility with the standard launcher.
* Supports only single player for now.
* Does some basic validation: official mods cannot be deselected, non single player mods cannot be selected, indicators when you place a mod before its dependencies.?

I am learning xaml (and the changes required for Avalonia) as I go, so my design choices might appear questionable.

As with all my projects, this will be maintained for as long as I am still interested in the game, feel free to fork or submit pull requests if you find me being too slow to react.
